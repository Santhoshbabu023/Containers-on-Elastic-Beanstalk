# Containers-on-Elastic-Beanstalk
This project demonstrates how to create a custom Docker image with Nginx, build and run it locally, and deploy the containerized app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The web application is served using a custom index.html file and deployed on the cloud for accessibility via a web browser.
